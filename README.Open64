0. Overview of Open64:
--------------------

Rice University's Open64 is a multi-platform version of the SGI
Pro64/Open64 compiler suite that includes new support for
source-to-source transformation.  

We are presently working on reconnecting this source-to-source
translation infrastructure into the back-end analysis to support
analysis-based transformations.

Open64 runs on the following platforms:
  *-Linux (x86, IA64, Opteron)
  alpha-Tru64
  mips-IRIX
  sparc-Solaris
  x86-cygwin

The Open64 web site is at:

=============================================================================

1. Getting started with Open64:
--------------------

Prerequisites:
  * CVS, for obtaining the sources
  * Recent version of GCC (e.g. 3.3.3) on Linux or vendor compiler on
    IRIX, Solaris, Tru64.  GCC should generally work on non-Linux
    systems, but will at least require a small change in the makefiles.
  * GNU make

Probably the most pain-free platform to build on is Linux with a
recent version of GCC.


1.1. Obtaining the Source
----

In order to reduce maintenance time, we distribute the source via CVS.
Please wee the instructions on our web site for obtaining the source
code.


1.2. Building Instructions
----

Unfortunately, within a multi-platform context, the build system
leaves quite a lot to be desired.

1. Choose an appropriate target directory depending on your platform

  targ_alpha_tru64/
  targ_ia32_ia64_linux/  (32-bit Linux and 32-bit Cygwin)
  targ_ia64_ia64_linux/  (64-bit Linux)
  targ_mips_irix/
  targ_sparc_solaris/

(N.B.: We do not support the other target directories!)

The rest of these instructions are relative to your target directory.

2. You may modify 'Makefile.platform' to:
  select compiler (BUILD_COMPILER is GNU or VENDOR)

3. Compile by running 'make' within the target directory.  Or, you can
individual compile components:

  F90 front end (mfef90):
    cd crayf90/sgi && make

  WHIRL IR tools (e.g., ir_b2a):
    cd ir_tools && make

  WHIRL-to-Fortran unparser (whirl2f)
    cd whirl2f && make

  WHIRL-to-C unparser (whirl2c)
    cd whirl2c && make


1.3. Installation Instructions.
----

There is currently no packaged installation procedure.  Running 'make
install' is not supported.  You should generally treat the top-level
INSTALL script the same as you would a lie.

2. For More Information:
--------------------

You can find more information on our web site.

Here is a list of some important documentation:
  documentation/pro64-docs/*
    This directory contains overviews of Pro64, which are helpful for
    understanding the big picture.

  documentation/open64.ps 
    A reference on the WHIRL abstract syntax tree and the WHIRL
    symbol table, including Rices changes.  Although it is not
    completely up to date, the good news is that it is very accurate
    (i.e. while it does not contain some new details, it does not
    generally mislead).
 
See our webpage for information on the OPEN64 mailing list.
