This directory is a part of a testsuite that can be used 
for regression testing. It contains single-file test programs 
and a python script testAll.py that automates the testing.

About the test cases in TestSources
  These are short programs that take no input. One file = one program.
  The only output allowed is either "OK" or "failed". 
  Please do not add any files that produce different 
  output or that require input. Each file has to contain a complete program 
  that can be compiled into an executable that can be run without
  any command line arguments.
  
the script is self explanatory. It requires OPEN64ROOT 
to be set to the architecture specific  
  Open64/osprey1.0/targ... directory 
If set in your environment it 
picks up your settings of F90C and F90FLAGS
