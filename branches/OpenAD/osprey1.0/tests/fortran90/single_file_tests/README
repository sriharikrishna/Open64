This directory is a part of a testsuite that can be used 
for regression testing. It contains single-file test programs 
and a Pearl script that automates the testing.

About the test cases:
  These are short programs that take no input. One file = one program.
  The only output allowed is either "OK" or "failed". 
  Please do not add any files that produce different 
  output or that require input. Each file has to contain a complete program 
  that can be compiled into an executable that can be run without
  any command line arguments.
  
About the script:
  The script is called runtests.pl. To see the usage type runtests.pl -help. 
  Before using the script, you will have to adjust the path to your 
  Open64/osprey1.0/targ... directory 
  (you can do this by changing $f90dir variable in the script 
  or by running the script with -f90dir=path command line option.
  What the script does:
  for each .f or .f90 file:
  run mfef90, run whirl2f, run f90, run executable
  The script reports success/failure at each of the above steps. 
  Outputs of different steps are stored in the logs subdirectory.
